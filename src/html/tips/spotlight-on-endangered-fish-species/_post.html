      Every year, many fish species become threatened or endangered due
      to anthropogenic impacts on their habitats. Conserving fish resources and biodiversity is a key task for
      maintaining
      the health of marine and freshwater ecosystems.

    <h2 class="subtitle">
      The problem of endangered species
    </h2>

    <p>
      The disappearance of fish species is driven by factors such as commercial fishing, habitat destruction, water
      pollution, and climate change. Many
      of these species play important roles in ecosystems, maintaining balance and providing sustenance for many
      societies.
    </p>

    <h2 class="subtitle">
      Conservation efforts
    </h2>

    <p>
      International organizations, governments, and non-profit organizations are actively working to protect and restore
      threatened fish species. This includes creating protected areas, limiting commercial fishing, restoring habitats,
      and conducting scientific research.
